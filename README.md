2022 MathorCup Mathematical Modeling Challenge - Big Data Competition

- The task was to price 5000 second-hand cars from 58.com.

- Used MATLABtoprocess and quantify the historical transaction data of 30000 second-hand cars, established the pricing
 model based on polynomial regression and ridge estimation, and used principal component analysis to identify 17 main
 factors that affect the transaction prices of second-hand cars, with a cumulative contribution rate of 87.72%.

- Applied the model to predict the prices of the target second-hand cars, where the average relative error of the test set
 was only 0.16, and provided reasonable sales suggestions for merchants.
